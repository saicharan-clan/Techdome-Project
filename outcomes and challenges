I faced issues with both the frontend and backend code in the Backend: https://github.com/Anand-1432/Techdome-backend
Frontend: https://github.com/Anand-1432/Techdome-frontend GitHub repository. The minor issues were due to mistakes in the code, and I encountered challenges while creating Kubernetes resources. 
To simplify the process, I used Kompose to convert Docker Compose files into Kubernetes manifests.

The primary issue in the Techdome-backend code was related to how the server was configured to listen for requests. Currently, the backend server listens on process.env.PORT but does not explicitly bind to a host. 
In a containerized environment (like Kubernetes), Express defaults to binding to localhost (127.0.0.1), which makes the server inaccessible from outside the container. To fix this, the server should bind
to 0.0.0.0 to ensure accessibility within the Kubernetes cluster.

During testing, the signup page had issues because the API was expecting a token, which should not be required for this functionality due to some code mistakes in Techdome-frontend git repository. 
However, other features such as login, blog creation 
(including uploading images, adding blog titles and descriptions), and logout worked correctly. The GUI for these functionalities behaved as expected.

I verified the functionality of the frontend, backend, and database services locally. Here are the results:

The frontend service worked fine, and its logs showed no errors.
The backend service also worked fine, and its logs were error-free.
The MongoDB database functioned correctly and worked seamlessly in the Kubernetes cluster.

I installed Minikube, kubectl, and Kompose to manage Kubernetes resources effectively. After testing the setup, everything, including the frontend, backend, and database, was operational except for the 
signup API issue.

I tested the services and shared output screenshots, including:
The GUI displaying the functioning login, blog creation, and logout features.
Local machine testing of the frontend, backend, and database services, all of which were working fine with no errors in the logs.
I had submitted a PDF with detailed implementation notes and these output screenshots. However, I was asked to provide a GitHub repository link. The repository contains the code, configuration files, and 
references to the shared screenshots.
